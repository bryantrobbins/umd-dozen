# This is a script to generate the slice for each
# event in a testcase. Thi script read the cobertura
# coverage report for an event, determines the method
# invoked in that event and runs the JavaSlicer to
# compute the slice for that event.
#
# Slices are generated for each testcase in the
# specified testsuite.
